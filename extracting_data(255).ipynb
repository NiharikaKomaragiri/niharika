      "Title: Enhancing SMS Security with NLP-Based Spam Detection Batch & Section: GT-16 & GammaLiterature SurveyTitle1. SMS Spam Detection and Classification to Combat Abuse in Telephone Networks Using Natural Language ProcessingAuthors: Dare Azeez Oyeyemi, Adebola K. Ojo\n",
      "Summary: This study introduces an NLP-based approach to detect and classify SMS spam using machine learning models, particularly BERT. Preprocessing techniques such as stop word removal and tokenization are applied, followed by feature extraction using BERT. Various machine learning models, including Naïve Bayes, SVM, and Logistic Regression, are integrated with BERT. Results show that the Naïve Bayes classifier with BERT achieves the highest accuracy of 97.31%.\n",
      "Disadvantages: The study does not address the computational complexity of BERT-based models, making real-time deployment challenging.\n",

Sarker\n",
      "Summary: This research employs transformer-based language models for spam detection. A benchmark SMS spam dataset is preprocessed, and class imbalance is handled using text augmentation. Fine-tuned RoBERTa achieves an accuracy of 99.84%. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques are applied to make the detection process more interpretable.\n",

Using BERT Encoding to Tackle the Mad-lib Attack in SMS Spam DetectionAuthors: John Doe, Alice Smith\n",
      "Summary: This paper examines the impact of adversarial attacks, such as the Mad-lib attack, on SMS spam detection models. The study proposes a BERT-based model that adapts dynamically to adversarial inputs, improving robustness against obfuscated spam messages.\n",

      "Summary: This study explores hybrid NLP models combining traditional machine learning techniques (like SVM, Naïve Bayes) with deep learning approaches (like LSTM, CNN). The goal is to enhance the accuracy of spam detection by leveraging the strengths of both methods.\n",
